This keyboard layout is for Android devices and works with [AnySoftKeyboard](http://code.google.com/p/softkeyboard/). For now it is not published yet. It is a Belarussian keyboard. So it must be chuvashized :-)

Chuvash Keyboard is [published on Market](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chuvash.android.anysoftkeyboard)
